Pseudorandom Orthogonal Transformations:

P:  is a linear operator that takes a vector and permutes its coordinates
Q:  is a linear operator that takes a vector and rotates the coordinates
Fd: a linear operator that takes a vector uses a one to one operator to 
        transform the vector from R^d to C^(d/2) multiplies this with a 
        Fourier transform matrix and then converts the vector back to R^d 

Theta: takes a vector and runs it through P and Q a 'm2' times then through
        Fd and then again through P and Q m1 times
