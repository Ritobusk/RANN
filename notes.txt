Pseudorandom Orthogonal Transformations:

P:  is a linear operator that takes a vector and permutes its coordinates
        Find out hopw you use the rng_engine
        Try sequentially
        Try parallel with split

Q:  is a linear operator that takes a vector and rotates the coordinates
        When applying eq 7 do it sequentially with a loop (maybe nontrivial?)
        Also do the rotations inplace instead of using map
        Normalize the rng_engines output numbers: (rand.ToFloat/(u32.highest number).ToFloat) Then scale with 2pi

Fd: a linear operator that takes a vector uses a one to one operator to 
        transform the vector from R^d to C^(d/2) multiplies this with a 
        Fourier transform matrix and then converts the vector back to R^d 
                Play around with complex numbers
                Create a matrix-vector multiplcation that works with complex numbers

Theta: takes a vector and runs it through P and Q a 'm2' times then through
        Fd and then again through P and Q m1 times
                Theta is a function that should permute all points similarly for an iteration of T

    


CENTER OF MASS OF THE COLLECTION?:
        https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/linear-momentum/center-of-mass/v/center-of-mass-equation
        Just add all the points and then divide the resulting vector with the number of points???
