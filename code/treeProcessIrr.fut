-- ToDos:
-- 1. Pass the desired `height` of the kd-tree as program parameter instead of `defppl`
-- 2. Fix the construction of the kd-tree to not split in the middle of a set of points
--      having the same value as the median.
--    Representation of kd-tree:
--      - You know that the tree is still fully balanced, but the number of points in
--        each leaf does not have to be the same.
--      - Therefore, when you are building the kd-tree, you need to keep track of the
--        shape of each level of the tree, i.e., level `i` has `2^i` nodes, hence it
--        corresponds to an arrray of `2^i` subarrays. The sum of the shape array has
--        to equal the number of reference points.
--      - on the rightside, you will probably pad with some empty arrays.
-- 3. adjust the rest of the code, i.e., of this file, to work with the new
--    kd-tree representation.
